; Problem Set 17

; A Network is a [List-of Person]
 
; A Person is a (make-person String Belief [List-of String])
(define-struct person [name belief friends])
; and represents their name, their belief, and the name of their friends
 
; A Belief is one of:
; - "blue"
; - "red"
 
(define NETWORK
  (list
   (make-person "Alice" "red" (list "Carol" "Heidi"))
   (make-person "Bob" "blue" (list "Carol" "Dan"))
   (make-person "Carol" "red" (list))
   (make-person "Dan" "blue" (list "Carol" "Eric" "Frank" "Grace"))

; Exercise 1

; update-network : Network -> Network
; updates every individual's belief to become the belief the majority of their friends have
; if there is a tie, then the belief is unchanged
