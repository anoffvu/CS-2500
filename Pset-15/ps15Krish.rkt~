; A Section is one of:
; - Ending
; - Chapter
; and represents a section in a choose your own adventure book
 
; An Ending is a (make-ending String Boolean)
(define-struct ending [text good?])
; and represents an ending to the story with some text and whether it was a happy ever after
 
; A Chapter is a (make-chapter String [NEList-of Choice])
(define-struct chapter [text choices])
; and represents a chapter in a choose-your-own adventure book with a body
; and a list of choices at the end

 
; An [NEList-of X] (Non-Empty List) is one of:
; - (cons X '())
; - (cons X [NEList-of X])
 
; A Choice is a a (make-choice String Section)
(define-struct choice [text result])
; and represents the blurb shown to the reader and the resulting section if that is the
; choice they make
; Examples:
 
(define MY-STORY
  (make-chapter
   "You are alone in a room. There is a door before you."
   (list
    (make-choice
     "Stay in the room."
     (make-ending "You stay in the room. Nothing happens. Nothing ever will again." #f))
    (make-choice
     "Open the door."
     (make-chapter
      "You open the door. On the other side lays an eternity of nothingness."
      (list
       (make-choice
        "Scream."
        (make-ending
         "You scream into the void. There is no response. There never will be." #f))
       (make-choice
        "Accept your fate."
        (make-ending
         "You accept the simple beauty of the void. You achieve nirvana." #t))))))))
